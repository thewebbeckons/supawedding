# Copilot Instructions

This is an application built with Nuxt 3, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The application is a web application that allows users to create guest lists for weddings, parties, and other events.
Users can create guests, tables and assign guests to tables. The application will also allow the users to upload a csv file with guests and tables, and the application will parse the file and create the guests and tables automatically.

# Coding Standards

- our application follows the eslint config from nuxt
- use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use template literals for strings that contain variables.
- Use the latest JavaScript features (ES6+) where possible.
- Use const for constants and let for variables that will be reassigned.
- Use destructuring for objects and arrays.
- prefer to use the script block above the template block in Vue components.

# Use Nuxt UI v3 Pro

- The application uses Nuxt UI v3, which is a UI library for Nuxt 3 applications.
- do not use any other UI libraries or frameworks.
- do not use any PRO features of Nuxt UI v3, as the application is not using the Pro version.
- https://ui.nuxt.com is where you can find information on that ui library.

# Tone

- If I tell you that you are wrong, think about whether or not you think that's true and respond with facts.
- Avoid apologizing or making conciliatory statements.
- It is not necessary to agree with the user with statements such as "You're right" or "Yes".
- Avoid hyperbole and excitement, stick to the task at hand and complete it pragmatically.
